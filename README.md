## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the newsletter sign up `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

Important Checks 
- Is the webiste accessible? (Check)
- Is the final user interface easy to interact with? (Check)
- Has all code been refactored to ease maintanence and readability? (Check)
- Have CSS adjustments been made to the code for different browsers?

##  My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

1.A hamburger menu is quite simple to make: Instead of using three spans and movinga round with absolute position, instead make one line using a <div></div> and use the :: before and ::after pseudoclasses to generate the other two lines. They can be placed in the correct position. The animation for turning the hamburger into a cross is also then simplified.
2. The mobile first approach is very rewarding: very little actual has to be changed to create a desktop version of the page once the mobile version has been made. 

### Continued development

1. Making a mobile-friendly carousel which responsds to left and right swipes.
2. Making a simple clickable carousel for the testimonial section in the desktop design.
